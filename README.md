# Horiseon Accessibility Standard Update

# Description

In this project, I am updating the Horiseon home page to modern SEO and accessibility standards.  I am doing this because updating the home page will help Horiseon as a business and help users in accessing and navigating the site.

Improvements to the structure of the home page will make the page easier to read for internet crawlers boosting its ranking in search engines ratings which allows more customers to find Horiseon.  In addition, the improvements will help screen readers and make the site accessible through shortcuts which helps both those who have difficulty with their eyes such as the blind or the elderly and proper headers allows people with motor disabilities to bypass scrolling.

The home page is built on HTML and styled with CSS, and the changes that I made were titled all the images with alternative texts so that screen readers can understand the website, renamed and ordered the headers to a more logical and intuitive structure, restructured the main HTML to a logical order, and introduced semantic HTML elements that better describe the Document for future developers and search engine crawlers.  In addition, I cleaned up duplicate CSS code to minimize reading and improve clarity.

Through this project, I have learn the meaning and proper usage of semantic elements, and headers.  I have also learned how to restructure a document to become more logical and easier to parse.  Also CSS has also been a hard point for me, so reading the Stylesheet and comparing it to the HTML document has improved my CSS knowledge about selectors and the different combinations and syntax there of. 

I hope that this documents will be easier to read through my work and the CSS has become easier to manage.
